1
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.343
You're a remarkable woman.

2
00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:14.614
At my door, a good omen. 

3
00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:19.243
Oh, you're a spectacular woman.

4
00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:20.443


5
00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:24.814
How can you be so calm and clever?

6
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.786
Who told you to be so brave and tender?

7
00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:32.786
How do you manage life and bender?

8
00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:37.057
How come not a saint nor sinner?

9
00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:41.129
How you enrich but never plunder?

10
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.014
You drift apart but merge like a river

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.086
Judging wisely, mostly an admirer

12
00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:52.900
Of all that's been and all that's prior.

13
00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:52.926


14
00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.371
You're a remarkable woman.

15
00:00:55.586 --> 00:01:00.043
Timeless in your own fashion.

16
00:01:00.457 --> 00:01:03.686
 At my door, a good omen.

17
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.486
Oh, you're a spectacular woman.

18
00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:08.686


19
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.129
Words are just a tangled form of art.

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.557
With each one, there's a counterpart.

21
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.500
Like a big messy pile of jars.

22
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.343
Santa's here with a flying cart.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.614
Remarking life here in a blizzard.

24
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.586
All I know is that you're my sweetheart.

25
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.671
Your touch like the warmth of a hearth.

26
00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:41.029
With you, I vow never to part.

27
00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:41.093


28
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.386
Timeless in your own fashion.

29
00:01:44.543 --> 00:01:48.771
Nothing less than a mighty weapon.

30
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:52.871
You're a remarkable woman.

31
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:56.243
At my door, a good omen.

32
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.429
Oh, you're a spectacular woman.

33
00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:02.110


34
00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:05.900
I think about you all the time.

35
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:09.471
I've got no shame, no nothing to hide.

36
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200
How is it going to be — all the walks of life

37
00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.000
knowing I'd have your hand as my wife?
